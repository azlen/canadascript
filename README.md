Canadascript
============
Welcome to Canadascript, eh?

##Getting Started
To begin on your journey into Canadianisms, grab the parser.js script.

To start a new project, load in the parser.js script like so:

`<script src="parser.js"></script>`

Now that you have loaded the parser, you may create the canadascript script tag:

`<script type="text/canadian"></script>`

Ehh... that was easy! Your code should probably look something like this now:

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>CANADA</title>
  <script src="parser.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <script type="text/canadian">
    //Your canadian code will go here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

Nice Work!

##How To Use?
Just follow the instructions and you will be coding canadian in no time, eh?
####Variables
Creating a variable is simple eh?

`my_new_variable = 'hello world' eh?`

Changing a variable is just like creating it!

`my_new_variable = 9000 eh?`

####Functions
To create a function:

```
O function_name, param1 param2 param3:
  //code goes here
sorry
```

or

```
O function_name:
  //code goes here
sorry
```

Sorry is a very common word used in Canadascript so you better get used to it now, eh?

here is an example of a function being used for real purposes...

```
O Canada, we stand on guard for thee:
  whadda'yat we+stand+on+guard+for+thee?
sorry

O Canada, 1 2 3 4 5 6!
```

Wow! the code above will console log `21`...

To call a function all you have to do is:

`O function_name, params!` or `O function_name, params.`

OR

`O function_name!` or `O function_name.`

And that brings us to...

####Console Log
You may have noticed that `whadda'yat` was used while explaining functions.

`whadda'yat` is how you console log things in Canadascript. Here is a simple use of it:

`whadda'yat 100?`

This will console log `100`.

I have been asked aboot this before, what does `whadda'yat` mean? Good question, it is not a common canadian slang. It originates mainly from Newfoundland and is a jumble of the words 'what are you at' and means 'what are you doing' or 'what are you up to'. Often when I console log something, I am trying to figure out what something is doing. And so, I found it fitting to use `whadda'yat` for console logs.

####For Loop
Here is an example of a for loop in Canadascript:

```
oot 'n aboot 10:
  //code goes here
sorry
```
This calls the code inside 10 times.

`10` is the number of times to iterate

`n` is the iteration counter (in this case it goes from 0 to 9)

This for loop is equivalent to this javascript for loop:
```
for(n = 0; n < 10; n++){
  //code goes here
}
```
