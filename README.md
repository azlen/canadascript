Canadascript
============
Welcome to Canadascript, eh?

##Getting Started
To begin on your journey into Canadianisms, grab the parser.js script.

To start a new project, load in the parser.js script like so:

`<script src="parser.js"></script>`

Now that you have loaded the parser, you may create the canadascript script tag:

`<script type="text/canadian"></script>`

That was easy! Your code should probably look something like this now:

```
<html>
<head>
  <title>CANADA</title>
  <script src="parser.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <script type="text/canadian">
    //Your canadian code will go here
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

##How To Use?
Work In progress... will add info here soon
